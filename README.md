# AMDCpuData
Just publically ripped information of AMD CPU Data that will be used in other projects

Information ripped from [https://www.amd.com/en/products/specifications/processors.html](https://www.amd.com/en/products/specifications/processors.html)

## How to use
I plan on using this as a submodule (which can be done using the following command: ```git submodule add https://github.com/tk-rs/AMDCpuData```) however you can use it however you would like. 

This will be used in my other main project [hwisak-rs](https://github.com/tk-rs/hwisak-rs) which you should check out sometime if you ever need the library.

Another good repository for Intel Information is https://github.com/toUpperCase78/intel-processors which can give you all information about Intel CPU's.
